    <dd>Robin briefly studied political science at university. While there he enrolled in theater. He found theater to
        be so intriguing that he left his first university and enrolled in Juliard. 
        In 1978, ABC caught wind of Robin Williams' act and were so impressed that they fast-tracked a new sitcom in which he'd play an alien. Though critics were initially skeptical about the premise, “Mork & Mindy” was a phenomenal hit and launched Robin Williams' incredibly successful career.

    <dd>"Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a disease associated with abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain. These deposits, called Lewy bodies, affect chemicals in the brain..." 
        Deposits in the brain create dementia, cause neuropathy, hallucinations and various other behavioral changes. "This condition typically affects older adults, most often developing between ages 50 and 85. The life expectancy of individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies varies; people typically survive about 5 to 7 years after they are diagnosed. REM sleep behavior disorder may be the first sign of dementia with Lewy bodies."</dd>
